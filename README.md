This script demonstrates a deep learning workflow for medical image classification using the **MedMNIST** dataset. It integrates **PyTorch** for model training and evaluation and **SHAP** for explainability. Below is a concise overview:

1. Dataset and Preprocessing**
- Uses the **MedMNIST** API to load datasets (e.g., `pathmnist`) with preprocessing (tensor conversion and normalization).
- Data is organized into train and test loaders for efficient batching.
---
2. CNN Model**
- Defines a convolutional neural network (`Net`) with:
  - **Convolutional Layers**: Feature extraction using ReLU, BatchNorm, and MaxPooling.
  - **Fully Connected Layers**: Classification into dataset-specific classes.
- Loads a pre-trained model (`cnnmodel.pt`) for evaluation.
---
3. SHAP Explainability**
- Creates multiple SHAP explainers (`DeepExplainer`) using subsets of the training data.
- Computes Shapley values to quantify feature (pixel) importance for predictions.
- Saves results (image indices, labels, Shapley values) into CSV files for analysis.
---
Key Features**
- **Parameters**: Configurable batch size, learning rate, and epochs.
- **Output**: Model predictions and interpretable Shapley values for each image.

This workflow combines accurate classification with explainability, making it useful for medical AI applications where interpretability is essential.
